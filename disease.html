    <div class="text">
      <p>Ellen had a complex medical history throughout her adult life.  She was burdened by type 1 and type 2 Diabetes, 
	  Multiple Myeloma (MM), and, later on, Multiple System Atrophy (MSA).  Each of these is incurable and requires 
	  creative solutions to stay in control and in remission.  For Ellen, clinical trials became part of the therapeutic 
	  regimen. She volunteered for four clinical trials.</p>
      <p>The last trial she volunteered for, in 2019, used a therapy referred to as ‘CAR-T’ to treat MM. A few months 
	  following the T-Cell infusion, Ellen started to have difficulties with her balance. We often debated but were unsure
	  if the persistent balance difficulties were related to the trial. Still, ultimately, this led to a diagnosis of MSA, 
	  a rare but aggressive form of Parkinsonism.</p>
      <p>The standard-of-care diagnosis for MSA involves a clinical assessment of one’s coordination and mobility. The 
	  typical therapy, which was FDA approved in 1975, is the same approach applied to those with Parkinson’s disease: 
	  dopamine replenishment with Carbidopa/Levodopa. Unfortunately, this therapy is far less effective for those with MSA.</p>
	  <p>Ellen died from MM. However, the MSA robbed her of her quality of life. Given the limited medical understanding of MSA, 
	  her family has partnered with the University of Washington by creating the Ellen Moss Robinson Research Fund to investigate 
	  this poorly understood disease.</p>
